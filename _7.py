"""
You can generate a simple maze starting with a rectangular array of cells. Each cell has
four sides. You remove sides (except from the perimeter of all the cells) until all the cellsare connected. Then you create an entrance and an exit by removing two sides from the
perimeter.Write a program using PIL for Python that takes as input the two integers N and M and then draws an N * M
maze.
