Question Eighteen
=================
Write a program to generate the locations of pixels along a rasterized line segment using
Bresenhamâ€™s algorithm. Check that your program works for all slopes and all possible
locations of the endpoints. What is the initial value of the decision variable?

BresenhamLine Class
-------------------

.. py:class:: BresenhamLine

   A class for generating pixel locations along a rasterized line segment using Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm.

   :ivar tuple start: (x, y) coordinates of the starting point.
   :ivar tuple end: (x, y) coordinates of the ending point.
   :ivar list points: List of pixel locations along the line.

   .. method:: __init__(start, end)

      Initialize the BresenhamLine object.

      :param tuple start: (x, y) coordinates of the starting point.
      :param tuple end: (x, y) coordinates of the ending point.

   .. method:: draw_line()

      Generate the locations of pixels along the rasterized line segment using Bresenham's algorithm.

   .. method:: create_image(filename='line_image.png')

      Create an image and draw the line on it.

      :param str filename: Name of the output image file (default is 'line_image.png').

   Example usage:

   .. code-block:: python

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          # Example usage
          start_point = (10, 20)
          end_point = (100, 80)

          bresenham_line = BresenhamLine(start_point, end_point)
          bresenham_line.draw_line()
          bresenham_line.create_image('output_line.png')
