Question Twenty Seven
=====================
In this assignment you will animate motions for an articulated figure. You will be
given an articulated 3D model and sets of keyframes specifying the orientations of
articulated joints at specific time steps. Your job is to interpolate the keyframes
smoothly over a time interval and display the articulated figure in an OpenGL
window so that it performs animated actions (e.g., walks, dances, etc.) in real
time.
