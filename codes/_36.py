"""
Using PIL for Python and docstrings and OOP:

36. With regard to framebuffer operations, you can start constructing a ray tracer using a
single routine of the form write_pixel(x, y, color) that places the value of color (either an
RGB color or an intensity) at the pixel located at (x, y) in the framebuffer. Write a
pseudocode routine ray that recursively traces a cast ray. You can assume that you have afunction available that will intersect a ray with an object. Consider how to limit how far
the original ray will be traced.
