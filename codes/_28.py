"""
Bezier curves and B-spline curves are useful in computer graphics and design due to their mathematical properties that allow for smooth and precise curve representation. Here's a brief explanation of their usefulness and an application scenario:

Usefulness of Bezier and B-spline curves (2 marks):

    Smooth Curve Representation: Bezier and B-spline curves provide a smooth and continuous representation of curves, making them suitable for creating aesthetically pleasing shapes and surfaces.

    Control Point Flexibility: Both types of curves allow control points to influence the shape of the curve, providing a flexible way to design and model complex shapes.

Application Scenario (1 mark):

One application where curves can be used as a reference is in computer-aided design (CAD). In CAD applications, designers use curves to create and manipulate shapes for various objects like cars, buildings, or industrial components. Bezier and B-spline curves enable precise control over the curves, allowing designers to create complex and accurate shapes with ease.

Subdivision of Triangular or Quadrilateral Meshes (Program):

Below is a simplified Python program using PIL for image visualization, docstrings for documentation, and OOP principles to perform subdivision of triangular or quadrilateral meshes. The program includes an averaging step to create a smoother surface:
"""

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

class MeshSubdivision:
    """
    Class for subdivision and smoothing of triangular or quadrilateral meshes.
    """

    def __init__(self, initial_mesh):
        """
        Initialize the mesh subdivision with an initial mesh.

        Parameters:
        - initial_mesh: List of vertices representing the initial mesh.
        """
        self.mesh = initial_mesh

    def subdivide(self):
        """
        Subdivide the mesh by adding new vertices and updating connectivity.
        """
        # Implement your subdivision logic for triangular or quadrilateral meshes

    def smooth_surface(self):
        """
        Apply an averaging step to smooth the surface of the subdivided mesh.
        """
        # Implement your smoothing logic based on the subdivided mesh

    def visualize_mesh(self):
        """
        Visualize the subdivided mesh using PIL.
        """
        # Implement your code to visualize the mesh using PIL

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    initial_mesh = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]  # Initial quadrilateral mesh
    mesh_subdivision = MeshSubdivision(initial_mesh)

    # Subdivide the mesh
    mesh_subdivision.subdivide()

    # Smooth the surface
    mesh_subdivision.smooth_surface()

    # Visualize the result
