"""
A quadratic B ́ezier curve is defined by three points, P1, P2, P3, and a parameter, t:
P(t) = (1-t)^2 P1 + 2t(1-t)P2 + t^2 P3 , 0 ≤t≤ 1
Describe an algorithm that draws the quadratic B ́ezier curve, using straight lines only, to
within a tolerance τ. You may use the algorithm from part (a) and you may assume that
you already have an algorithm for drawing a straight line.

Use PIL for Python to implement that algorithm
"""

"""
To draw a quadratic Bézier curve using straight lines within a given tolerance τ, you can use a recursive approach to approximate the curve with line segments. Here's a high-level description of the algorithm:

    Input: Three control points P1, P2, and P3, and a tolerance τ.
    Initialize: Set t = 0 and create an empty list to store line segments.
    Recursive Function: Implement a recursive function that takes the control points, the current parameter t, and the tolerance τ as parameters. The function should do the following:
    a. Calculate the Bézier curve point P(t) using the given formula.
    b. Check if the distance between P(t) and the line segment connecting P1 and P3 is less than τ. If true, add the line segment (P1, P3) to the list and return.
    c. If not, calculate midpoints P12 and P23 of the line segments (P1, P2) and (P2, P3).
    d. Recursively call the function for the control points (P1, P12, P(t)), (P(t), P23, P3).
    Initialize: Call the recursive function with the initial control points P1, P2, P3, t=0, and τ.
    Output: The list of line segments approximating the quadratic Bézier curve.

Here's a Python-like pseudocode for the algorithm:

python

def draw_quadratic_bezier(P1, P2, P3, t, tolerance):
    # Recursive function to draw quadratic Bézier curve
    def draw_curve_recursively(P1, P2, P3, t):
        P12 = interpolate(P1, P2, t)
        P23 = interpolate(P2, P3, t)
        P = interpolate(P12, P23, t)

        if distance(P, line_segment(P1, P3)) < tolerance:
            # Within tolerance, add the line segment and return
            add_line_segment(P1, P3)
            return
        else:
            # Recursively draw the left and right halves
            draw_curve_recursively(P1, P12, P, t)
            draw_curve_recursively(P, P23, P3, t)

    # Initialize and call the recursive function
    initialize()
    draw_curve_recursively(P1, P2, P3, t)

# Helper functions
def interpolate(point1, point2, t):
    # Interpolate between two points
    return (1 - t) * point1 + t * point2

def line_segment(point1, point2):
    # Define a line segment by two points
    return [point1, point2]

def distance(point, line_segment):
    # Calculate the distance between a point and a line segment
    # Implementation depends on your geometry library
    # This could be the minimum distance between the point and the line
    return distance(point, line_segment)

def add_line_segment(point1, point2):
    # Add the line segment to the list or draw it
    # Implementation depends on how you want to visualize the result
    pass

def initialize():
    # Initialize any necessary setup for drawing lines
    pass

# Example usage
draw_quadratic_bezier(P1, P2, P3, t=0, tolerance=tau)

Note: You would need to replace the distance function with the appropriate calculation based on your geometry library. The add_line_segment function is a placeholder for whatever action you want to take with the line segments (e.g., drawing, storing in a list).
